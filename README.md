# Movie Rating Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict the rating of a movie based on features such as genre, director, and actors. The goal is to analyze historical movie data and develop a model that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or critics. This project provides insights into the factors that influence movie ratings and allows the development of a model that can estimate ratings accurately.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about movies, including their ratings, genres, directors, and actors. 

## Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values
- Encode categorical features using one-hot encoding
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets

## Feature Engineering
- Calculate correlations between features and target variable
- Select features with high correlation coefficients

## Model Building
- Train machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor) on the training data

## Model Evaluation
- Evaluate model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

## Predictions
- Make predictions on test data and new data

## Visualization
- Visualize actual vs predicted ratings using scatter plots

## Interpretation
- Analyze the scatter plot to assess the model's performance and identify areas for improvement

## Dependencies
- Python 3
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn (for optional visualization)
